## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create a set of visualizations that will help convince investors that a bike-sharing program in NYC is a solid business proposal. The visualizations will show the following:

1.The data shows there is demand for bikes in NYC. 
2.The data shows that the business could be sustainable in the long term based on the number of rides per day.
3.The data shows that the business could be profitable simply off of the number of rides alone. 

## Results

The results of the analysis are as follows:

1.The data shows there is demand for bikes in NYC. The number of rides per hour is highest during the morning and evening rush hours. The number of rides per hour is lowest during the middle of the night. The number of rides per hour is highest during the summer months. The number of rides per hour is lowest during the winter months. The number of rides per hour is highest during the weekdays. The number of rides per hour is lowest during the weekends.

2.The data shows that the business could be sustainable in the long term based on the number of rides per day. The number of rides per day is highest during the summer months. The number of rides per day is lowest during the winter months. The number of rides per day is highest during the weekdays. The number of rides per day is lowest during the weekends.

3.The data shows that the business could be profitable simply off of the number of rides alone.
